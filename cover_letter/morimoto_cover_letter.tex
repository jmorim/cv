\lettercontent{Hello,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information
% on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you
% found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's
% name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{I'm applying for the research associate position at your company,
    Dicerna, referred to me by an employee from the Colorado division, Jason
    Serio. Jason's wife, Nicole, and I worked together in Mindy Levine's
    research group during my undergraduate degree at the University of Rhode
    Island, where we both worked on enhanced fluorescence detection of
    polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
}


   
% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer
% the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the
% requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills
% and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.  Try
% to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several
% shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can
% be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined
% with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to
% <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER
% CAREER>.  <RELEVANT LIFE STORY/ WORK/ PROJECT > In own projects, my
% coursework, work as a <PREVIOUS JOB TITLE> I have applied knowledge of
% <SUBJECT MATTER>.  <LIST OF SMART SOUNDING SKILLS AND TOOLS>.  Combining these
% tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT>
% answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

\lettercontent{During my PhD research in Al Robbat's laboratory at Tufts
    University, I studied metabolic changes in tea plants influenced by the
    environment by using multidimensional
    chromatography, both liquid and gas, coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). This
    experience has made me particularly skilled in method development using
    reverse-phase separations and detection/identification/quantification by
    MS\@.  Additionally, I've served as an organic chemistry teaching assistant
    for three semesters, and spent my undergraduate research performing organic
syntheses. I believe my hybrid background as an organic analytical chemist makes
me a strong candidate for the position offerred.}

\lettercontent{I'm particularly eager to work for your company because I
find RNA interference as a therapy interesting. I previously did an internship
at Pfizer in Groton, CT and it was a rewarding experience to contribute to
research in medicine.}

% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you
% for the position. 

\lettercontent{Thank you for considering my application. I plan on graduating
from my PhD program between December 2020 and February 2021 and look forward to
your response.}
