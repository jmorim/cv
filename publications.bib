    ABSTRACT={Insect herbivores have dramatic effects on the chemical
              composition of plants. Many of these induced metabolites
              contribute to the quality (e.g., flavor, human health benefits) of
              specialty crops such as the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Induced
              chemical changes are often studied by comparing plants damaged and
              undamaged by herbivores. However, when herbivory is quantitative,
              the relationship between herbivore pressure and induction can be
              linearly or non-linearly density dependent or density independent,
              and induction may only occur after some threshold of herbivory.
              The shape of this relationship can vary among metabolites within
              plants. The tea green leafhopper (Empoasca onukii) can be a
              widespread pest on tea, but some tea farmers take advantage of
              leafhopper-induced metabolites in order to produce high-quality
              “bug-bitten” teas such as Eastern Beauty oolong. To understand the
              effects of increasing leafhopper density on tea metabolites
              important for quality, we conducted a manipulative experiment
              exposing tea plants to feeding by a range of E. onukii densities.
              After E. onukii feeding, we measured volatile and non-volatile
              metabolites, and quantified percent damaged leaf area from scanned
              leaf images. E. onukii density had a highly significant effect on
              volatile production, while the effect of leaf damage was only
              marginally significant. The volatiles most responsive to
              leafhopper density were mainly terpenes that increased in
              concentration monotonically with density, while the volatiles most
              responsive to leaf damage were primarily fatty acid derivatives
              and volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids. In contrast, damage
              (percent leaf area damaged), but not leafhopper density,
              significantly reduced total polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate
              (EGCG), and theobromine concentrations in a dose-dependent manner.
              The shape of induced responses varied among metabolites with some
              changing linearly with herbivore pressure and some responding only
              after a threshold in herbivore pressure with a threshold around
              0.6 insects/leaf being common. This study illustrates the
              importance of measuring a diversity of metabolites over a range of
              herbivory to fully understand the effects of herbivores on induced
              metabolites. Our study also shows that any increases in leafhopper
              density associated with climate warming, could have dramatic
              effects on secondary metabolites and tea quality.}

    sources of stress simultaneously, yet little is known about interactive
    effects of multiple stressors on plant metabolic responses. Plants are well
    known to respond to both drought and insect herbivory through the induced
    production of secondary metabolites. However, severe drought stress limits
    photosynthesis and may therefore inhibit the production of induced secondary
    metabolites in response to herbivory due to carbon limitation. On the other
    hand, drought-stressed plants may be primed to respond more strongly to
    herbivory due to hormonal crosstalk or redundancy of metabolites that are
    produced in response to drought and herbivory. We tested the interactive
    effects of drought and simulated herbivory in tea plants (Camellia sinensis
    (L.) Kuntze var. sinensis) grown in the field under varying rainfall
    interception treatments and then exposed to an exogenous methyl jasmonate
    (MeJA) treatment. We show that severe drought generally inhibits the
    induction of secondary metabolites by exogenous MeJA (simulated herbivory).
    However, a few volatile metabolites, including methyl salicylate, are more
    strongly induced by MeJA in severely drought-stressed plants compared to
    moderately stressed plants, possibly due to priming by drought stress. Our
    approach of using multiple levels of drought stress and a
    targeted/untargeted approach to measuring volatile metabolites was essential
    to discovering these patterns of induction. In addition to having
    implications for plant-herbivore interactions in the presence of abiotic
    stress, these results have important implications for tea quality." }

    distinct colors, that contribute to overall quality and consumer acceptance.
    Atypical rind pigments are frequently reported in small-scale cheese
    production, but the causes of these color defects are largely unknown. We
    provide a potential microbial explanation for a striking purple rind defect
    in a surface-ripened cheese. A cheese producer in the United States reported
    to us several batches of a raw-milk washed-rind cheese with a distinctly
    purple rind. We isolated a Proteus species from samples with purple rind
    defect, but not from samples with typical rind pigments, suggesting that
    this strain of Proteus could be causing the defect. When provided
    tryptophan, a precursor in the indigo and indirubin biosynthesis pathway,
    the isolated strain of Proteus secreted purple-red pigments. A Psychrobacter
    species isolated from both purple and normal rinds also secreted purple-red
    pigments. Using thin-layer chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass
    spectrometry, we confirmed that these bacteria produced indigo and indirubin
    from tryptophan just as closely related bacteria make these compounds in
    purple urine bag syndrome in medical settings. Experimental cheese
    communities with or without Proteus and Psychrobacter confirmed that these
    Proteobacteria cause purple pigmentation of cheese rinds. Reports of purple
    rinds in two other cheeses from Europe and the observation of pigment
    production by Proteus and Psychrobacter strains isolated from other cheese
    rinds suggest that purple rind defect has the potential to be widespread in
    surface-ripened cheeses." }
